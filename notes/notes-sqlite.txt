
Notes
-----

In sqlite favour TEXT rather than STRING as STRING data may be coerced to an numeric type
if it is number-like.

If you are doing everything with just raw SQL you only need System.Data.SQLite Core:
PM> Install-Package System.Data.SQLite.Core

Or you can add the other stuff (install EntityFramework first):
PM> Install-Package EntityFramework
PM> Install-Package System.Data.SQLite.EF6
PM> Install-Package System.Data.SQLite.Linq
PM> Install-Package System.Data.SQLite

Don't need fsi to be in the src directory of the project.

When to open and close connections:

To add a reference to System.Data, right click on 'References'; click "Add Reference..." and find 'System.Data' in 
Assemblies > Framework.

Porbably should use a transaction to increse speed...

See this answer that shows how to create databases:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15292880/create-sqlite-database-and-table
Note however, creating tables with SQL is much more tractable than creating them with functions.
